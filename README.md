# FCAN-MOPSO
The implementation of FCAN-MOPSO.
### Source Code
The source code of FCAN-MOPSO, which is illustrated with the Cora dataset as an example.
The eventual purpose of FCAN-MOPSO is to obtain the optimal membership matrix for graph clustering.
### Datasets
All the datasets used in our paper. These datasets are the ones we have already processed.
### Evaluation Metric Code
The code for solving the evaluation metrics.
Its main inputs are the optimal membership matrix obtained by FCAN-MOPSO and the ground_truth of the original data in the dataset.
